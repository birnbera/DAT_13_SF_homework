This is approximate since we don't know how the missing values might have affected the mean. Other ways to deal with the missing values are to fill them in with the mean calculated as above, which won't affect the mean, but might affect the median in future calculations. You could also try to guess the values from the other data in case there is a correllation with other metrics, such as class. If future calculations using the age can accept weights associated with the data you could give reported ages a weight of 1 and then guess the ages of the rest using a function that could give a probability that would serve as the weighting factor."

However, if multiple people use the same ticket number, such as families, or if consecutive numbers of the tickets indicate that they were purchased together, then you might expect the ticket numbers to indicate something significant. To incorporate the ticket numbers you could calculate the Hamming distance between all the tickets as a matrix and include the matrix as a set of features during prediction. This could become computationally intractible though with so many tickets (essentially adding that many features to each passenger).\n",

I would probably run the analysis both with and without these features."
